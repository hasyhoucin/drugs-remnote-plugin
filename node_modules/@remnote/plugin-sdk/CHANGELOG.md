### Added

- Added `cardId: string | undefined` parameter to the `SRSScheduleCard` callback. Note that `cardId` is `undefined` when the method is called to calculate interval dates for the interval spacing visualization on the Custom Scheduler settings page. But when calculating scheduling dates for cards, the `cardId` should always be defined.

## 0.0.20

Note that this release contains a **breaking change**.

### Removed

- (BREAKING): removed the `plugin.rem.createWithMarkdown` method. It has been replaced by two new methods: `plugin.rem.createSingleRemWithMarkdown` and `plugin.rem.createTreeWithMarkdown`.

### Added

- Added `plugin.rem.createTreeWithMarkdown(markdown)` method. This method creates a tree of Rem from your parsed markdown. Newlines will be turned into separate sibling/child Rem.
- Added `plugin.rem.createSingleRemWithMarkdown(markdown)` method. This method creates a single Rem from your parsed markdown. Newlines will NOT be turned into separate sibling/child Rem.

## 0.0.19

### Added

- Added a new namespace for accessing knowledge base information. To access a user's knowledge base information, your plugin needs to add the KnowledgeBaseInfo permission scope in the manifest.json file. See the [permission scope docs](https://plugins.remnote.com/advanced/permissions#permission-scopes) for more detail.
- Added `plugin.kb.getCurrentKnowledgebaseData` and `plugin.kb.isPrimaryKnowledgeBase` methods

### Other Changes

- We now support uploading unlisted plugins for personal use. See the [unlisted plugins docs](https://plugins.remnote.com/advanced/unlisted_plugins) for a guide on how to upload and install unlisted plugins.

## 0.0.18

### Added

- Added a new method called `plugin.app.transaction` to run code inside a transaction. If the code throws an error, the transaction will be not be saved to disk. Be careful not to hold transactions open for extended periods of time, as this might block other parts of the app.

### Theming and CSS

- We now support uploading simpler CSS snippet plugins which only contain CSS. Simply copy and paste your CSS snippet into a snippet.css file, zip and upload. No need to mess around with GitHub or JS! See the [Custom CSS docs](https://plugins.remnote.com/custom-css) for a guide on how to do this.

### Other Changes

- Updated the `plugin.rem.createWithMarkdown` function so that if the markdown string contains newlines, a single Rem is created containing newlines, rather than a separate Rem for each newline.
- Added `clickOutsideToClose?: boolean` parameter to the `plugin.widget.openPopup` method.
- Added `addTitle?: boolean` parameter to the `plugin.rem.createLinkRem` method.

## 0.0.17

### Added

- Added a new method to create Rem representing web links called `plugin.rem.createLinkRem`.
  - If you want to include the link in rich text, use the `plugin.richText.rem` method and pass the link Rem's `_id` as an argument

### Fixes and Improvements

- Made some minor changes related to fix special callback handling. This should only affect custom SRS scheduler plugins.

## 0.0.16

### Fixes and Improvements

- Small fix to the `RepetitionStatus` interface, renaming the `customData` field to `pluginData`.

## 0.0.15

This version adds support for Plugin SRS Schedulers as well as some new features and bug fixes.

### Added

#### Plugin SRS Schedulers

With this release RemNote now supports Plugin SRS Schedulers. It will be possible to install Plugin Schedulers through the plugin marketplace and customize them in the Custom Scheduler settings page.

- Added a new `plugin.scheduler` namespace.
- Added a `plugin.scheduler.registerCustomScheduler` method to register a plugin scheduler with custom scheduler parameters.
- Upated the `plugin.app.registerCallback` command to optionally take a generic parameter. This is used to provide type inference for the special `SRSScheduleCard` callback.

#### Other Additions

- Added a new parameter `closeWhenClickOutside?: boolean` to the `plugin.window.openFloatingWidget` method. It is true by default.
- Added support for custom placeholders to the `RichTextEditor` components through a new `placeholder` prop.
- Added a new `QueueLoadCard` event which fires each time a card changes in the queu so you can keep track of what the current card in the queue is.
- Added a new widget location filter field called `remId` to the `registerWidget` options parameter. Plugins can now register widgets in locations filtered by a particular Rem Id.

### Fixes and Improvements

- Fixed an issue with localhost plugins failing to activate.
- Fixed editor text not immediately updating when calling the `rem.setBackText` method.
- Fixed the `RichText` component throwing an error and refusing to load.
- Fixed button click events not working in native plugins.
- Fixed registered plugin commands not always getting added to the Omnibar and Slash Command Menu.

## 0.0.14 - 2022-09-22

### Fixed

- Fixed incompatibility of the `npx` scripts with lower node versions.

## 0.0.11..0.0.13 - 2022-09-22

Skipped.

## 0.0.10 - 2022-09-20

This version we focused on tooling around plugin creation.

### Added

- `npx` scripts to initialise and validate a plugin before upload.
  - `npx remnote-plugin init` command to generate the manifest.json file with an interactive prompt.
  - `npx remnote-plugin validate` to validate the plugin before uploading.
- Support plugin template npm scripts on Windows.
- Json schema and linting for `manifest.json`.
- `richText.indexOfElementAt` function to convert a string index to a rich text element array index.

### Fixes and Improvements

- Fix `getSelectedRem` and `getSelectedText` reactivity.
- Removed stealKeys and releaseKeys methods from the editor namespace. They have already been moved into the app namespace.

### Theming and CSS

- Added `data-rem-property` and `data-rem-container-property` data attribute to target slot instances like `[[Aliases]]`.

## 0.0.9 - 2022-08-31

### Fixed

- Fix `window.stealKeys`, `window.releaseKeys` and `app.unregisterWidget` calling wrong endpoints.

## 0.0.8 - 2022-08-31

### Changed

- Manifest: `repoUrl` is required for now.
- Manifest: `enabledOnMobile` (boolean) must be set if the plugin should run on mobile. Make sure the plugin does require any features not supported on mobile yet, like the right sidebar.
- - âœ¨ Completely refactored the [`editor`](https://plugins.remnote.com/api/classes/EditorNamespace) namespace.
  - This makes it more suitable for programmatically modifying content. We plan to reintroduce methods to simulate user actions.
- [`Rem` class](https://plugins.remnote.com/api/classes/Rem)
  - Renamed `Rem.tagAncestorRem` to `Rem.ancestorTagRem` and `Rem.tagDescendantRem` to `Rem.descendantTagRem`.
  - Renamed `Rem.u` to `Rem.updatedAt` and `Rem.o` to `Rem.localUpdatedAt`.
  - Renamed `(set)isCollapsedPortal` to `(set)isCollapsed`.
- `RichTextBuilder` normalizes rich text now. This turns `value()` into an `async` method.
- Changed `getFocusedPortalId(): RemId ` to `getFocusedPortal(): Rem`.
- Removed `getDescendantIds(): RemId[]` in favor of `getDescendants() : Rem[]`.
- Moved `stealKeys`/`releaseKeys` into the `app` namespace.
- Moved `getWidgetContext` into the `widget` namespace.
- Flattened context data for `WidgetLocation.Popup` (`context.openContext.focusedRemId` -> `context.focusedRemId`)

### Added

- âœ¨ Added 18 new methods to the [`richText`](https://plugins.remnote.com/api/classes/RichTextNamespace#methods) namespace
  - General: `empty`, `indexOf`, `length`
  - Modification: `replaceAllRichText`, `split`, `splitRichText`, `trim`, `trimStart`, `trimEnd`
  - Formatting: `removeTextFormatFromRange`, `applyTextFormatFromRange`, `applyTextFormatFromRange`
  - Conversion: `toHTML`
  - Linking: `getRemIdsFromRichText`, `deepGetRemIdsFromRichText`, `getRemAndAliasIdsFromRichText`, `deepGetRemAndAliasIdsFromRichText`, `findAllExternalURLs`
- âœ¨ Added experimental [`rem.getAll()`](https://plugins.remnote.com/api/classes/RemNamespace#getall) and [`card.getAll()`](https://plugins.remnote.com/api/classes/CardNamespace#getall) methods to get all rem or cards respectively. Use with care on large KBsðŸ˜„.
- âœ¨ Added experimental shotcut capturing system to implement custom keyboard controls, like a VIM mode.
- Support reactivity in the index widget. Wrap your API calls in `plugin.track()` and they rerun automatically when something has changed.
- Make `focus.focusedRem()` and `focus.getFocusedPortal()` reactive and add `AppEvents.FocusedRemChange` and `AppEvents.FocusedPortalChange` events for manual tracking.
- Add `AppEvent.PowerupSlotChanged` event to watch for powerup changes, like todo status or highlight color.
- Added `date.getDailyDoc(date: Date)`.
- Added `Rem.removeTag(tagId: RemId, removeProperties = false)`. If `removeProperties` is specified all slots of the tag will be removed as well.
- Added `Rem.removePowerup(powerupCode)`. It will always remove all powerup slots.
- Added `onlyProgrammaticModifying: boolean` and `hidden: boolean` [powerup slot options](https://plugins.remnote.com/advanced/powerups#registering-custom-powerups). Set these to ensure data consistency.
- Added `widget.closeAllFloatingWidgets()`.

### Fixes and Improvements

- Many methods accept `Rem` as parameter in addition to `RemId`. `Rem` wrapper objects are the preferred way to work with rem and we want to abstract away `RemId`s as best as possible.
- Fix `AppEvents.QueueCompleteCard` event being triggered too often.
- Fix `RichTextBuilder` duplicating references.
- Make `searchContextRemId` optional in [`search.search()`](https://plugins.remnote.com/advanced/search#global-rem-text-search). If you omit the context rem searches globally.
- Typings: Add return type for all methods that were still returning `Promise<any>`.
- Typings: Type `Rem.setHighlightColor` with the available highlight colors.
- Typings: Add `RepetitionStatus` type.

### Theming and CSS

- Added `data-cloze-id` data attribute to Fill-In-The-Blank elements.
- Added `rn-plugin-root` class to the plugin `iframe` (sandboxed) or `div` (native) node.

### Other

- Add _Repository_ and _Report bugs_ links to the marketplace details page.
- Manifests are now validated on build.

## 0.0.7 - 2022-08-01

- Change `getFocusedRemId(): RemId` to `getFocusedRem(): Rem`.

### Added

- Added `Rem.addPowerup(powerupCode: BuildInPowerupCodes)`.
- Added `widget.getDimensions(widgetInstanceId: number)`. You can get the `widgetInstanceId` from the `getWidgetContext()`.
- Added `remId` to the widget context of [`WidgetLocation.UnderRemEditor`](https://plugins.remnote.com/api/interfaces/WidgetLocationContextDataMap#underremeditor).

### Fixes and Improvements

- Some `Rem` methods had the wrong permission levels.

### Other

- Added documentation for the [`search`](https://plugins.remnote.com/advanced/search) namespace.
- Added documentation for the [`richText`](https://plugins.remnote.com/advanced/rich_text) namespace.
- Added documentation for [Floating Widgets](https://plugins.remnote.com/advanced/widgets#floating-widgets) and [Popup Widgets](https://plugins.remnote.com/advanced/widgets#popup-widgets) and [Pane Widgets](https://plugins.remnote.com/advanced/widgets#pane-widgets).
